# Node.js Nigeria Contributing Guide

**Please note**: We encourage everyone to ask questions either by asking in a discussion or opening an issue whenever they are confused or unsure about anything.
We'll do everything we can to help you contribute to Node.js Nigeria in any way possible.
Don't be afraid of doing anything wrong. Even if you do, someone will kindly guide you on how to make the necessary corrections.

## Code Of Conduct

Our Code of Conduct explains the behavioral expectations we require from everyone who is or seeks to be a part of Node.js Nigeria.
You can access it [here](https://github.com/nodejsnigeria/admin/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it carefully before participating.

## Vocabulary

* A **Contributor** is any individual creating or commenting on an issue or pull request.
* An **Administrator** is a contributor who has been given write access to the the relevant repo(s) and has voting rights.

## Choosing a good first Issue to work on

Take a look at any issues tagged as `good first issue` to have an easier time getting started on your first contribution!

## Logging Issues

Log an issue for any question or problem you might have. When in doubt, log an issue,
any additional policies about what to include will be provided in the responses. The only
exception is security disclosures which should be sent privately. If you have a concern that is Code
of Conduct related and do not feel comfortable reporting publicly, please reach out to an individual listed under [Node.js Nigeria Administrators](https://github.com/nodejsnigeria/admin/blob/master/members.md)

An administrator may direct you to another repository, ask for additional clarifications, and
add appropriate metadata before the issue is addressed.

Please be courteous, respectful, and every participant is expected to follow the
project's Code of Conduct.

## Contributions

Any change to resources in this repository must be through pull requests (colloquially referred to as "PRs"). This applies to all changes, both non-code and code: documentation, process-related contributions, etc. Even administrators must use pull requests.

No pull request can be merged without being reviewed.

For non-trivial contributions, pull requests should sit for at least 36 hours to ensure that other contributors have time to review. Consideration should also be given to weekends and other holiday periods to ensure active administrators all have reasonable time to become involved in the discussion and review process if they wish.

The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no administrator has an objection. During review, administrators may also request that a specific contributor who is most versed in a particular area gives a "LGTM" before the PR can be merged. There is no additional "sign off" process for contributions to land. Once all issues brought by administrators are addressed, it can be landed by any administrator.

In the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another admistrator, all involved administrators should seek to arrive at a consensus by way of addressing concerns being expressed by discussion, compromise on the proposed change, or withdrawal of the proposed change.

Administrators are expected to follow this policy and continue to send pull requests, go through proper review, and have other administrators merge their pull requests.

## How We Make Decisions

Node.js Nigeria uses a "consensus seeking" process for issues that are escalated to the administrators.
We try to find a resolution that has no open objections among the administrators.
If a consensus cannot be reached that has no objections then a majority wins vote
is called. It is also expected that the majority of decisions made by the administrators are via
a consensus seeking process and that voting is only used as a last-resort.

Resolution may involve returning the issue to administrators with suggestions on how to
move forward towards a consensus. It is not expected that a meeting of the administrators
will resolve all issues on its agenda during that meeting and may prefer to continue
the discussion happening among the adminstrators.
